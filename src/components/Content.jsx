      <p className="font-poppins text-lg">
        We prioritize threat modeling based on platform-specific risks. Security-first, we identify and mitigate vulnerabilities beyond functionality testing. Using white-box and
        black-box tests, we conduct thorough vulnerability assessments. Maintaining transparency, we communicate openly with the CDP team. Emphasizing clarity, we present
        actionable insights for efficient issue resolution.
